2. **ContextAnalysisAgent** provides document intelligence to inform other agents' decisions
3. **ContentGenerationAgent** creates and modifies content based on context and user requirements
4. **FormattingAgent** applies visual styling and layout optimization to content
5. **DataIntegrationAgent** provides external information and data to enhance content
6. **ValidationAgent** ensures quality and accuracy before changes are applied
7. **ExecutionAgent** performs the actual LibreOffice operations with proper error handling

This modular design enables flexible workflow patterns while maintaining clear separation of concerns and reliable error handling throughout the system.
