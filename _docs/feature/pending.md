## Integration Workflow Implementation ðŸ”„

According to `diagram.md`, the complete communication flow needs implementation:

### 1. User Interaction â†’ Agent Processing Flow
```
User types in chat â†’ AIPanel::OnSendMessage() â†’ AgentCoordinator â†’ LangGraph Bridge â†’

## Updated Implementation Status Summary

Based on the actual codebase investigation, the implementation status is significantly more advanced than originally indicated:

### What's Actually Complete âœ…
- **Complete LibreOffice C++ infrastructure** (100% of Phase 1)
- **Comprehensive UI system** with AIPanel, ChatHistory, AITextInput components
- **Full backend foundation** with AgentCoordinator, DocumentContext, MessageQueue, NetworkClient, WebSocketClient, AuthenticationManager, ErrorRecoveryManager
- **UNO service integration** with proper component registration
- **Build system integration** with proper GTK UI layout and sidebar registration

### What Remains To Be Built ðŸ”„
- **Python LangGraph agents system** (langgraph-agents/ directory completely missing)
- **Document operations bridge** (sw/source/core/ai/operations/ directory missing)
- **Financial API integration** and specialized document templates
- **Agent workflow coordination** between Python LangGraph and existing C++ infrastructure

The foundational architecture is **completely implemented and ready**. The remaining work is focused on creating the **Python multi-agent intelligence layer** and the **document manipulation bridge** that will leverage the comprehensive C++ infrastructure that's already been built.

This represents a much more mature starting point than initially understood, with the core LibreOffice integration challenges already solved.
