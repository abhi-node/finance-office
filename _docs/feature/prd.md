# LibreOffice AI Writing Assistant: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Clear Objective

**Outcome**: Add a single AI chat icon to LibreOffice Writer's sidebar that provides users with intelligent document assistance through natural language conversation.

**Feature**: When users click the AI icon in the sidebar, a chat panel opens where they can:
- Request document edits, formatting, and content generation through natural language
- Get real-time financial data integrated into their documents
- Receive writing assistance, grammar checking, and style improvements
- Access all document manipulation capabilities through conversational AI

The AI assistant operates through a sophisticated LangGraph multi-agent architecture but presents a simple chat interface to users.

## Context

### What's Already in Place

**LibreOffice Writer Architecture**:
- Mature UNO (Universal Network Objects) service architecture for component integration
- Existing sidebar framework with SwPanelFactory for panel creation
- Established document model (SwDoc, SwNode hierarchy) with shell layers for editing operations
- OAuth2 integration framework already supporting external API connections
- Extension system supporting sophisticated component registration and deployment

**Existing Integration Patterns**:
- SwPanelFactory.cxx demonstrates sidebar panel creation with contextual arguments
- Component registration through XML-based service declarations
- Document manipulation through established UNO service interfaces
- Configuration management through LibreOffice's hierarchical config system

**Document Processing Infrastructure**:
- SwDoc central document repository with manager pattern delegation
- SwTextNode, SwTableNode, SwGrfNode for different content types
- SwFrame hierarchy for layout and visual representation
- Event-driven processing through LibreOffice's event framework

### What's Assumed

**Technical Foundation**:
- LangGraph framework will be integrated as the AI agent orchestration system
- External financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) will be available for data integration
- LibreOffice's existing UNO service patterns can be extended for AI operations
- Users have LibreOffice Writer installed and are familiar with basic document editing

**User Expectations**:
- Users expect chat-based AI interaction similar to modern AI assistants
- Document manipulation should happen seamlessly without disrupting existing workflows
- AI responses should be contextually aware of current document state and cursor position

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

**LibreOffice Compatibility**:
- Must integrate with existing UNO service architecture without breaking compatibility
- Cannot modify core LibreOffice Writer interface beyond adding the sidebar icon
- Must respect LibreOffice's cross-platform requirements (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Integration must follow established extension patterns and component registration

**Performance Requirements**:
- AI responses must be delivered within 5 seconds for typical operations
- Memory overhead cannot exceed 100MB for base functionality
- Must handle documents up to 500 pages without performance degradation
- Cannot impact LibreOffice startup time by more than 2 seconds

**Security and Privacy**:
- All external API calls require explicit user consent
- Document content must be processed locally whenever possible
- API credentials must be stored using LibreOffice's secure credential management
- Must comply with enterprise privacy policies and data protection requirements

### UI/UX Constraints

**Minimal Interface Impact**:
- Only UI addition allowed is a single sidebar icon
- No new menus, toolbars, dialog boxes, or interface modifications
- Must integrate seamlessly with LibreOffice's existing sidebar system
- Cannot disrupt existing keyboard shortcuts or user workflows

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Chat interface must support screen readers and accessibility tools
- Must follow LibreOffice's established accessibility standards
- Keyboard navigation must be fully supported throughout the chat interface

### Integration Constraints

**External Dependencies**:
- Must handle API rate limits and service failures gracefully
- Cannot require always-on internet connectivity for basic functionality
- Must support offline mode with cached data and local processing
- API integrations must be configurable and optional

## Reasoning

### Why This Architecture

**LangGraph Multi-Agent Approach**:
- **Specialization**: Each agent (DocumentMaster, ContextAnalysis, ContentGeneration, Formatting, DataIntegration, Validation, Execution) handles specific tasks, making the system maintainable and extensible
- **Coordination**: Shared state management enables agents to work together while maintaining document context
- **Scalability**: New capabilities can be added as additional agents without disrupting existing functionality
- **Fault Tolerance**: Individual agent failures don't compromise the entire system

**Single Chat Interface Design**:
- **Familiar Interaction Model**: Users are accustomed to chat-based AI interactions from modern AI tools
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One interface for all AI capabilities eliminates the need to learn multiple UI elements
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Chat conversation maintains context across multiple requests and operations
- **Non-Intrusive Integration**: Minimal UI footprint preserves LibreOffice's clean interface design

### Why Build on Existing Patterns

**UNO Service Extension**:
- **Proven Architecture**: LibreOffice's UNO services already handle complex document manipulation reliably
- **Compatibility Assurance**: Using established patterns ensures compatibility with existing features and future updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverages LibreOffice's existing optimizations for document operations
- **Maintenance Simplicity**: Following established patterns reduces long-term maintenance complexity

**Sidebar Integration**:
- **Consistent User Experience**: Sidebar is the established location for auxiliary tools in LibreOffice
- **Contextual Availability**: Sidebar tools are document-context aware and appropriately positioned
- **Flexible Usage**: Users can open/close the AI assistant as needed without disrupting document editing
- **Resource Efficiency**: Sidebar panels can be loaded on-demand, optimizing resource usage

### Why Financial Data Specialization

**Market Differentiation**:
- **Unique Value Proposition**: Financial document creation with real-time data integration is underserved in open-source office suites
- **Professional Use Cases**: Financial professionals represent a high-value user segment with specific needs
- **API Integration Showcase**: Financial APIs demonstrate the system's external integration capabilities

**Technical Synergy**:
- **Data Visualization**: Financial data naturally requires charts, tables, and formatted presentations that showcase document manipulation capabilities
- **Real-Time Requirements**: Financial data integration tests the system's performance and responsiveness
- **Accuracy Demands**: Financial documents require high accuracy, validating the multi-agent quality assurance approach

### Why Maintain LibreOffice Principles

**User Control**:
- **Transparency**: Users understand what AI operations are being performed and can control their execution
- **Privacy Protection**: Local processing priority and explicit consent for external API access maintain user data control
- **Configurability**: All AI features can be customized or disabled according to user preferences

**Open Source Values**:
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports community contributions and customizations
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Users aren't dependent on proprietary AI services for core functionality
- **Transparency**: Open-source implementation allows users to understand and modify AI behavior
